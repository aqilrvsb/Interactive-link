# ✅ PUBLIC PREVIEW - No Login Required!

## What's Fixed:

### 1. **Preview is NOW PUBLIC**
- **No login required** to view previews
- Anyone can access the URLs
- Perfect for sharing with clients

### 2. **Projects Default to Public**
When you save a project:
- Automatically set as `is_public: true`
- Instantly shareable
- No permissions needed

## How It Works:

### **For You (Creator):**
1. Save project → Automatically public
2. Click Preview → Opens clean URL
3. Share URL with anyone

### **For Clients/Viewers:**
1. Receive URL: `yoursite.com/1/abc123`
2. Open in browser
3. **NO LOGIN REQUIRED**
4. See the website immediately

## URL Access Levels:

### **Public Access (No Login):**
- Storage files (always public)
- Projects marked as public
- Preview URLs work for everyone

### **Fallback Routes:**
```
/1/projectId         → With user ID
/preview/projectId   → Generic preview
/live/1/projectId    → Alternative format
```

## Testing:
1. **Log out** of your account
2. Visit a preview URL
3. It should load **without login**!

## Benefits:
- ✅ **Client-Friendly** - No account needed
- ✅ **Instant Access** - Open and view
- ✅ **Shareable** - Send to anyone
- ✅ **Professional** - Works like a real website

## Summary:
Preview URLs are now completely public! Share them with anyone - no login, no barriers!
