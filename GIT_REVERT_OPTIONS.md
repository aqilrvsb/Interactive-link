# ðŸ”„ Git Revert Options - Choose What to Revert

## Option 1: Revert to Before Today's Changes (Recommended)
This will revert ALL changes made today and go back to the last working state from yesterday:

```bash
git reset --hard ec2054b
```

This takes you back to: "Add final SQL script to fix HTML rendering without policy conflicts"

## Option 2: Selective Revert - Keep Some Changes
If you want to keep documentation but revert code changes:

### Revert PreviewPage.tsx to earlier version:
```bash
git checkout ec2054b -- src/pages/PreviewPage.tsx
```

### Revert FileManager.ts to earlier version:
```bash
git checkout ec2054b -- src/utils/fileManager.ts
```

### Revert WebsiteBuilder.tsx to earlier version:
```bash
git checkout ec2054b -- src/pages/WebsiteBuilder.tsx
```

## Option 3: Revert Specific Problem Commits

### The main problematic commits appear to be:
1. **c7ed772** - Fix undefined project error (might have introduced new bugs)
2. **43226dc** - Remove Supabase Storage references (might have broken working code)
3. **a04f0db** - Fix 406 error (changed query logic)
4. **cbb09b2** - Database storage with srcDoc (major change)

To revert just the most recent changes:
```bash
git revert c7ed772
git revert 43226dc
```

## Option 4: Manual Fix - See What Was Working Before

### Check the WORKING version of PreviewPage from yesterday:
```bash
git show 8878e8b:src/pages/PreviewPage.tsx > PreviewPage_WORKING.tsx
```

### Check the WORKING version of FileManager from yesterday:
```bash
git show 8878e8b:src/utils/fileManager.ts > fileManager_WORKING.ts
```

## My Recommendation:

Based on the errors, I suggest **Option 1** - full revert to before today's changes:

```bash
cd C:\Users\aqilz\Documents\Interactive-link-main
git reset --hard ec2054b
git push --force origin main
```

This will:
1. Revert all today's changes
2. Go back to when storage was working
3. Keep all your work from before today

Then you can:
1. Test if preview works again
2. Apply fixes more carefully one by one
3. Test after each change

Would you like me to execute the revert for you?
