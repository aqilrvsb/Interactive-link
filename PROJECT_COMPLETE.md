## 🚀 **WHAT'S WORKING NOW:**

### **Sequential User IDs:**
- Users automatically get IDs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
- First user = #1, Second user = #2, etc.

### **URL Structure:**
```
/{user_id}/preview/{project-name}
```

### **Examples:**
- User #1 creates "my-website" → `/1/preview/my-website`
- User #2 creates "portfolio" → `/2/preview/portfolio`
- User #150 creates "blog" → `/150/preview/blog`

### **Features:**
1. ✅ Create projects with unique URLs
2. ✅ Rename projects (updates slug)
3. ✅ Delete projects (removes files)
4. ✅ Preview opens actual HTML files
5. ✅ No conflicts between users

## 📱 **PRODUCTION URLs:**

Once deployed on Railway:
```
https://interactive-link-production.up.railway.app/1/preview/my-project
https://interactive-link-production.up.railway.app/2/preview/portfolio
https://interactive-link-production.up.railway.app/150/preview/website
```

## 🔧 **TESTING STEPS:**

1. **Sign up first user** → Gets ID #1
2. **Sign up second user** → Gets ID #2
3. **Create projects** → Each gets unique URL
4. **Test rename** → URL updates
5. **Test delete** → File removed
