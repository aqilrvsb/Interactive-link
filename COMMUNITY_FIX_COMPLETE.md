# ✅ Community Page Fix - COMPLETED

## 🎯 Issue Fixed
The community page was showing an error:
```
Could not find the function public.get_user_emails(user_ids) in the schema cache
```

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Removed Dependency on get_user_emails RPC Function**
- The code was trying to call a non-existent database function `get_user_emails`
- This function was trying to access auth.users table which is restricted in Supabase

### 2. **Updated to Use Profiles Table**
- Modified `communityUtils.ts` to fetch usernames from the `profiles` table
- Uses the following priority for display names:
  1. Username (if available)
  2. Full name (if available)
  3. "Anonymous" (fallback)

### 3. **Files Modified**
- `src/utils/communityUtils.ts` - Removed RPC call, uses profiles directly
- `src/utils/userUtils.ts` - Added `getDisplayName` alias for compatibility
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Updated to use new display name function

## 📊 Database Structure
Your `profiles` table has:
- `user_id` (uuid) - Links to auth.users
- `username` (text) - User's display name
- `full_name` (text) - User's full name
- No email field (emails are in auth.users which is restricted)

## ✨ Benefits
- No more RPC function errors
- Cleaner code without complex auth.users access
- Uses existing profiles data
- Better privacy (no email exposure)
- Consistent username display across the app

## 🚀 Deployment
All changes have been pushed to GitHub and will automatically deploy to Vercel.

## 🔍 Testing
After deployment, the community page should:
- Load without errors
- Display usernames from profiles
- Show "Anonymous" for users without profiles
- Work consistently across all pages

## 📝 Optional: SQL Script
If you want to create the RPC function for future use, run `FIX_GET_USER_EMAILS.sql` in Supabase SQL editor, but it's no longer needed with the current implementation.
